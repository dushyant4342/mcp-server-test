## Project Overview: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server — now integrated into Windsurf to streamline workflow management!

Previously, pulling data from multiple sources (web search, code, local files) meant juggling messy APIs and custom scripts — a major blocker for scaling and automation.

Now, with MCP servers, everything is unified into a single, modular workflow — making development faster, cleaner, and far more reliable.

### 🔗 Tools Integrated

- **🔎 Brave Search MCP** – Real-time web results ([Get API Key](https://brave.com/search/api/))

- **🛠️ GitHub Search MCP** – Search and manage code or repositories
  - **How to set up:**
    1. Create a GitHub Token: Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens and generate a new token with the required permissions (such as `repo` and `read:org`).
    2. Register the Token: Go to https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github (MCP server registry) and paste your GitHub token to create the JSON configuration needed.
    3. Use the generated JSON in the Cascade → Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers section, and you're all set! You can now start interacting with the MCP server through the Windsurf UI.

- **🗂️ Filesystem MCP** – Local file access and management (no API needed)
